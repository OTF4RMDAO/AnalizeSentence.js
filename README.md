# Sentence Analysis Project

## Overview
This project consists of a JavaScript function that analyzes a given sentence and provides three key outputs:
- The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
- The number of words in the sentence (assuming words are separated by a single space).
- The number of vowels in the sentence.

## Features
- Counts the total number of characters in the sentence.
- Calculates the number of words based on spaces.
- Identifies and counts the vowels (both uppercase and lowercase).
- Handles various sentence structures while ensuring the last character is a period.

## Requirements
- JavaScript (Node.js)
